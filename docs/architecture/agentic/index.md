# Agentic Architecture

## Overview
Agentic system architecture and lifecycle documents for CHAOS.

Architecture version: 1.5.0 (Architecture Audit Pass)

CHAOS is a framework for building self-improving, persistent digital entities. It utilizes a dual-process theory of mind: every Chaos agent consists of an Actor (the active, task-oriented consciousness) and a Subconscious (the background process responsible for reflection, maintenance, and growth). This structure ensures that agents do not just perform tasks, but adapt based on their experiences and direct Architect feedback.
