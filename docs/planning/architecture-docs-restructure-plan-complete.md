# Architecture Docs Restructure Plan

## Purpose
Restructure architecture documentation into separate core and agentic sections under the new indexed documentation hierarchy.

## Scope
Create the new directory structure and migrate legacy architecture content into the correct section with minimal continuity assumptions.

## Contents
1. Establish `docs/architecture/core/` and `docs/architecture/agentic/` with section indexes.
2. Move core architecture documents from the migrated archive into `docs/architecture/core/`.
3. Migrate the legacy `docs/migrate_from/architecture.md` into `docs/architecture/agentic/`.
4. Update `docs/architecture/index.md` to link to core and agentic sections.
5. Validate links and note remaining gaps for follow-up.
