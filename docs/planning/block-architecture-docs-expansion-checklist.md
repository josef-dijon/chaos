# Block Architecture Docs Expansion Checklist

## Status
Draft

## Purpose
Track execution of the block architecture docs expansion plan.

## Scope
Checklist for documentation updates and index consistency.

## Contents
- [x] Phase 1: Audit existing core block docs; write glossary; capture open questions.
- [x] Phase 2: Canonical `Request`/`Response`/`metadata` schemas and reserved keys.
- [x] Phase 3: Deterministic execution semantics (leaf + composite) and block state machine.
- [x] Phase 4: Recovery semantics (policy interfaces, attempts, backoff, overrides).
- [x] Phase 5: Ledger semantics + tool/side-effect safety rules.
- [x] Phase 6: Observability + testing guidance for deterministic unit tests.
- [x] Phase 7: Update `docs/architecture/core/index.md` and verify every doc is indexed exactly once.
